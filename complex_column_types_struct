Struct: Named fields, of possible mixed types

If we want to save and retrieve a group of information together and each item has different type, 'structs' are useful. 

Art History   {auhor: mr a
              year_published:2000
              language: English}
Colurs        {author: miss b

Artists       {author:mrs c
               year_published:2011
               language: Russian}

select title, details.author, details.language from art_books;

Art History   mr a      English
Colours       miss b    French
