Map: Key-Value pairs, the same type for each key and each value

If we want to save and retrieve a group of information together and have them with a key such as label, without having to use a separate row of data for each or keeping the data in another table, 'maps' are useful. For example if a book is published in several languages in different years, we can keep the year in an map field together with a key for language.

Art History   {EN:1998, FR:2000}
Colurs        [EN:2001, DR:2005, FR:2010}
Artists       {EN:2007, RU:2011}

select title, year['FR'] as year_fr from published_year;

Art History   2000
Colours       2010
Artists       null

hive >   create table   published_year (
     >   title string,
     >   year map<string:int>
     >   row format delimited
     >   fields terminated by ','
     >   collection items terminated by '|'
     >   map keys terminated by ':';     
     
Data File will look like as below:
Art History, EN:1998 | FR:2000
Colours, EN:2001 | DR:2005 | FR:2010
Artists, EN:2007 | RU:2011
