Bucketig is a way to divide data by values, similar to partitioning. Bucketing allows the distribution of the records across a pre-defined number of buckets. This will allow jobs to use sample of data. Joins are faster if all records are bucketed on join column.

create table art_book_buckets (
isbn string,
title string,
published_year int,
language string)
clustered by isbn into 10 buckets;

Columns selected for bucketing should have well distrubuted values.

Note: Remeber to set hive.enforce.bucketing = true so that the number of reducers are set to the number of buckets in the table.

insert overwrite table art_book_buckets
select * from art_books;

10% data sampling from bucketed table

select * from art_books_buckets
tablesample (bucket 1 out of 10 on isbn);
